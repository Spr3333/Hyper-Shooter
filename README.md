# Hyper-Shooter
Our entry for the College Game Awards was a collaborative effort among myself and two friends. While one focused on crafting the UI to perfection, another lent their talents to the realm of sound and visual effects. As for me, I delved deep into the intricacies of game mechanics. Our creation was a culmination of various techniques, including the implementation of splines, ragdolls, constraints, and inverse kinematics, among others. Though we didn't secure the award, the journey was invaluable. We poured our hearts into the project, pushing our limits and gaining a wealth of knowledge along the way.
